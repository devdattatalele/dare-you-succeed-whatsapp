# WhatsApp BetTask Message Spam Fix

## Problem
The WhatsApp BetTask backend was continuously sending messages from old chats and trials, causing message spam. This happened because:

1. **Old messages in database**: The WhatsApp MCP bridge stores all messages in a local SQLite database
2. **No timestamp tracking**: The system was reprocessing the same old messages repeatedly
3. **Ineffective deduplication**: The message deduplication logic wasn't working properly for older messages
4. **No persistent state**: Even after clearing WhatsApp chats, messages remained in the local database

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Persistent Timestamp Tracking
- Added `last_processed_timestamp.txt` file to track the last processed message timestamp
- System now only processes messages newer than this timestamp
- Prevents reprocessing old messages after restarts

### 2. Improved Message Deduplication
- Enhanced message key generation with timestamp: `{chat_jid}_{message_id}_{timestamp}`
- Better handling of processed message cache
- Only processes messages that haven't been seen before

### 3. Direct Database Query
- Replaced the indirect WhatsApp MCP API calls with direct SQLite queries
- More reliable and efficient message retrieval
- Better filtering of messages by timestamp and content

### 4. Reset Utility Script
- Created `reset_message_processor.py` to manage the system
- Can reset timestamp to stop processing old messages
- Provides system status and cleanup options

## Usage

### Stop Message Spam (Emergency)
```bash
python reset_message_processor.py
```
This resets the timestamp to current time, preventing processing of existing messages.

### Check System Status
```bash
python reset_message_processor.py --status
```

### Process Recent Messages Only
```bash
python reset_message_processor.py --reset-hours 2
```
This sets the system to process messages from the last 2 hours only.

### Clear Old Messages
```bash
python reset_message_processor.py --clear-old
```
Removes messages older than 7 days from the database.

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `main.py`: Enhanced message polling with timestamp tracking
- `reset_message_processor.py`: New utility script for system management

### Key Functions Added
- `load_last_processed_time()`: Loads persistent timestamp
- `save_last_processed_time()`: Saves timestamp to file
- `get_new_messages_from_db()`: Direct database query for new messages

### Database Query
The system now uses this SQL query to get only new messages:
```sql
SELECT id, chat_jid, sender, content, timestamp, is_from_me, 
       media_type, filename, url
FROM messages 
WHERE timestamp > ? 
AND is_from_me = 0
AND (content IS NOT NULL AND content != '')
ORDER BY timestamp ASC
LIMIT 50
```

## How It Prevents Spam

1. **Timestamp Gate**: Only processes messages newer than the last processed timestamp
2. **One-time Processing**: Each message is marked as processed and never processed again
3. **Persistent State**: Timestamp survives system restarts
4. **Direct Control**: Reset utility allows manual control over what gets processed

## Safe Restart Process

1. If experiencing message spam:
   ```bash
   python reset_message_processor.py
   ```

2. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. The system will now only process new incoming messages, not old ones.

## Future Prevention

- The system automatically updates the timestamp as it processes new messages
- Old processed message cache is periodically cleared
- Messages older than the timestamp are permanently ignored
- No manual intervention needed for normal operation
