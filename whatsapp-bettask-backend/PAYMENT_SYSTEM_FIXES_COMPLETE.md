## âœ… **All Issues Resolved Successfully!**

### **Issues Fixed:**

#### 1. **Payment Screenshots Not Being Processed** âœ…

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced image detection in `main.py` to be more aggressive

- Improved logging for payment screenshot processing
- Any image sent by a user with pending payments is now treated as payment proof

**Solution**:
- Fixed `FundHandler.handle_payment_screenshot()` to properly find and assign payments
- Added logic to find recent pending payments and assign them to the correct user
- Improved payment approval process with better error handling
- **Result**: User now has **â‚¹400** in their wallet (4 payments of â‚¹100 each)

#### 3. **"Sorry, I had trouble processing" Errors** âœ…

**Problem**: New users were being registered with null email/password.

**Solution**:
