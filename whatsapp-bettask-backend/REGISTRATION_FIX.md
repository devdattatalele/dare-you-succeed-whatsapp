# Registration System Fix

## Issue Resolved ✅

**Problem**: New user registration was failing with error:
```
❌ Error creating account. This could be due to:
• Database connection issues
• Missing database tables  
• Duplicate phone number
```

## Root Cause

The registration handler was trying to insert a `password` field into the `profiles` table, but this column doesn't exist in the database schema.

**Database Schema**:
- `profiles` table columns: `['id', 'email', 'full_name', 'avatar_url', 'created_at', 'phone', 'balance']`
- **Missing**: `password` column

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated `_create_user_account()` method:
- Removed `password` field from profile insertion
- Added proper `full_name` field (derived from email)
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Added error handling with stack traces

### 2. Updated `_store_registration_details()` method:
- Modified to accept optional `password` parameter
- Store password in `payment_requests.metadata` for future authentication
- Added proper logging for tracking registration flow

### 3. Key Changes:

**Before** (causing error):
```python
profile_data = {
    "phone": phone,
    "email": email,
    "password": password,  # ❌ Column doesn't exist
    "balance": 0.0,
    "created_at": datetime.now().isoformat()
}
```

**After** (working):
```python
profile_data = {
    "phone": phone,
    "email": email,
    "full_name": email.split("@")[0],  # ✅ Valid column
    "balance": 0.0,
    "created_at": datetime.now().isoformat()
}
```

## Registration Flow (Now Working)

1. **Start**: User sends "register" or "start"
2. **Email**: User provides email address
3. **Password**: User provides password (stored in metadata)
4. **Amount**: User provides initial wallet amount
5. **Account Creation**:
   - ✅ Profile created in `profiles` table
   - ✅ Wallet created in `wallets` table  
   - ✅ Payment request created in `payment_requests` table
   - ✅ Registration details stored in metadata

## Test Results

```
✅ Registration flow starts properly
✅ Email validation and storage works
✅ Password validation and storage works  
✅ Account creation succeeds
✅ Wallet creation works
✅ Payment request creation works
✅ User lookup after registration works
```

## Next Steps for Users

1. **Complete Registration**: New users can now register successfully
2. **Payment**: After registration, users get UPI payment instructions
3. **Verification**: Users send payment screenshot for verification
4. **Activation**: Account becomes fully active after payment verification

## Server Status

- **Running**: Port 8001 (localhost:8001)
- **Database**: ✅ Connected to Supabase
- **Registration**: ✅ Fixed and working
- **AI**: ✅ Gemini API configured
- **WhatsApp**: ⚠️ MCP bridge needs reconnection

## Security Note

Currently passwords are stored as plain text in metadata for basic authentication. In production, implement proper password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2, etc.) and user authentication system.
